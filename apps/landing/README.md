# SendAm Landing Site

The SendAm landing site is a Vite + React marketing page that introduces the product — WhatsApp-first payments on the Stellar network — and links visitors to the admin dashboard.

Part of the [SendAm](../../README.md) monorepo.

## Pages

```text
/                 Landing page
```

## Environment Variables

Create `apps/landing/.env`:

```env
VITE_ADMIN_URL=http://localhost:3001
```

## Develop

From the repository root:

```bash
npm install
npm run dev:landing   # http://localhost:3000
```

## Build

```bash
npm run build --workspace=apps/landing
```

## Deployment

The landing site builds to static assets, so it deploys to Vercel as a static
site. [`vercel.json`](vercel.json) lives in this directory, and Vercel only
reads `vercel.json` from a project's root directory — so set **Root Directory**
to `apps/landing` for its security headers, SPA fallback rewrite, and
service-worker headers (`dist/sw.js`) to be applied.

```text
Root Directory:    apps/landing
Install Command:   npm install
Build Command:     npm run build      # vite build
Output Directory:  dist
```

Vite replaces `import.meta.env.VITE_*` at build time, so both variables are
baked into the bundle and must be set before the build runs — a restart or a
runtime-only change will not pick them up. Add them under
**Settings → Environment Variables**:

```text
VITE_ADMIN_URL         https://admin.your-domain.com
VITE_WHATSAPP_NUMBER   2348012345678
```

`VITE_ADMIN_URL` falls back to `http://localhost:3001` when unset;
`VITE_WHATSAPP_NUMBER` can stay empty to let WhatsApp pick the chat.

For a custom domain, add it under **Settings → Domains** and point its DNS at
Vercel, which provisions the TLS certificate. `VITE_ADMIN_URL` should then
point at the admin app's own domain, for example
`https://admin.your-domain.com`.

To deploy from the repository root instead, leave Root Directory empty and use:

```text
Build Command:     npm run build --workspace=apps/landing
Output Directory:  apps/landing/dist
```

In that layout Vercel does not read `apps/landing/vercel.json`, so copy it to
the repository root if you need the headers and rewrite there.

## Test

From the repository root:

```bash
npm run test:landing
```

Runs component/smoke tests (navigation, CTAs, FAQ) and `jest-axe` accessibility
checks against the rendered home page with Vitest + Testing Library, in jsdom.
No live services or network access required. CI runs this on every PR via the
`landing-tests` job in [`test.yml`](../../.github/workflows/test.yml).
